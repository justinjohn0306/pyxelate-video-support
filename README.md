Super Pyxelate converts images to 8-bit pixel art. It is an improved, faster implementation of the [original Pyxelate](https://github.com/sedthh/pyxelate/releases/tag/1.2.1) algorithm with palette transfer support and enhanced dithering. 

*Super Pyxelate is currently in beta.*

*Special thanks to [original Pyxelate](https://github.com/sedthh/pyxelate).*

# Usage

Once installed, Pyxelate can be used either from the command line or from Python.

```bash
$ pyxelate examples/blazkowicz.jpg output.png --factor 14 --palette 7

Pyxelating examples/blazkowicz.jpg...
Wrote output.png
```

Use `pyxelate --help` for a full list of command-line options, which map onto the
Python arguments described below.

Invoking from Python:

```python
from skimage import io
from pyxelate import Pyx, Pal

# load image with 'skimage.io.imread()'
image = io.imread("examples/blazkowicz.jpg")  

downsample_by = 14  # new image will be 1/14th of the original in size
palette = 7  # find 7 colors

# 1) Instantiate Pyx transformer
pyx = Pyx(factor=downsample_by, palette=palette)

# 2) fit an image, allow Pyxelate to learn the color palette
pyx.fit(image)

# 3) transform image to pixel art using the learned color palette
new_image = pyx.transform(image)

# save new image with 'skimage.io.imsave()'
io.imsave("pixel.png", new_image)
```
![Definitely not cherry picking](/examples/p_blazkowicz.png)

Pyxelate extends scikit-learn transformers, allowing the same learned palette to be reused on other, aesthetically **similar** images (so it's somewhat like an 8-bit style transfer): 

```python
car = io.imread("examples/f1.jpg")
robocop = io.imread("examples/robocop.jpg")

# fit a model on each
pyx_car = Pyx(factor=5, palette=8, dither="none").fit(car)
pyx_robocop = Pyx(factor=6, palette=7, dither="naive").fit(robocop)

"""
pyx_car.transform(car)
pyx_car.transform(robocop)
pyx_robocop.transform(car)
pyx_robocop.transform(robocop)
"""
```
![Fit Transform Palette](/examples/p_fit_transform.png)

For a single image, it is possible to call both fit() and transform() at the same time:

```python
# fit() and transform() on image with alpha channel
trex = io.imread("examples/trex.png")
trex_p = Pyx(factor=9, palette=4, dither="naive", alpha=.6).fit_transform(trex)
```

## Hyperparameters for Pyx()
| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| height | The height of the transformed image. If only height is set, the width of the transofmed image will be calculated to maintain the aspect ratio of the original. |
| width | The width of the transformed image. If only width is set, the height of the transofmed image will be calculated to maintain the aspect ratio of the original. |
| factor | The size of the transformed image will be `1. / factor` of the original. **Can be used instead of setting width or height.** |
| upscale | Resizes the pixels of the transformed image by upscale. Can be a positive `int` or a tuple of ints for `(h, w)`. Default is `1`. |
| palette | The number of colors in the transformed image. <br /> - If it's an `int` that is larger than 2, Pyxelate will search for this many colors automatically. Default is `8`. <br /> - If it's a `Pal` palette enum object, Pyxelate will use palette transfer to match these colors.|
| dither | The type of dithering to use on the  transformed image (see more exampels below):<br />- `"none"` no dithering is applied (default, takes no additional time)<br />- `"naive"` Pyxelate's naive dithering based on probability mass function (use for images with **alpha channel**) <br />- `"bayer"` Bayer-like ordered dithering using a [4x4 Bayer Matrix](https://www.visgraf.impa.br/Courses/ip00/proj/Dithering1/) (fastest dithering method, use for large images)<br />- `"floyd"` Floyd-Steinberg inspired [error diffusion dithering](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering) (slowest)<br />- `"atkinson"` Atkinson inspired [error diffusion dithering](https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/) (slowest) |
| svd | Apply a truncated SVD (`n_components=32`) on each RGB channel as a form of low-pass filter. Default is `True`. |
| alpha | For images with transparency, the transformed image's pixel will be either visible/invisible above/below this threshold. Default is `0.6`. |
| sobel | The size of the sobel operator (N*N area to calculate the gradients for downsampling), must be an `int` larger than 1. Default is `3`, try `2` for a much faster but less accurate output. |
| depth | How many times should the Pyxelate algorithm be applied to downsample the image. More iteratrions will result in blockier aesthatics. Must be a positive `int`, although it is really time consuming and should never be more than 3. Raise it only for really small images. Default is `1`. |
| boost | Adjust contrast and apply preprocessing on the image before transformation for better results. In case you see unwanted dark pixels in your image set this to `False`. Default is `True`. |

## Assigning existing palette
Common retro palettes for different hardware (and others like the [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) fantasy console) are available in `Pal`:

```python
from pyxelate import Pyx, Pal

vangogh = io.imread("examples/vangogh.jpg")

vangogh_apple = Pyx(factor=12, palette=Pal.APPLE_II_HI, dither="atkinson").fit_transform(vangogh)
vangogh_mspaint = Pyx(factor=8, palette=Pal.MICROSOFT_WINDOWS_PAINT, dither="none").fit_transform(vangogh)
```

![Ever wondered how classical paintings would look like in MS Paint?](/examples/p_vangogh.png)
Assign your own palette:
```python
my_pal = Pal.from_hex(["#FFFFFF", "#000000"])

# same but defined with RGB values
my_pal = Pal.from_rgb([[255, 255, 255], [0, 0, 0]])
```

Fitting existing palettes on different images will also have different results for `transform()`.

# Installation

# FAQ
The source code is available under the **MIT license** 
but I would appreciate the credit if your work uses Pyxelate (for instance you may add me in the Special Thanks section in the credits of your videogame)!

## How does it work?
Pyxelate downsamples images by (iteratively) dividing it to 3x3 tiles and calculating the orientation of edges inside them. Each tile is downsampled to a single pixel value based on the angle the magnitude of these gradients, resulting in the approximation of a pixel art. This method was inspired by the [Histogram of Oriented Gradients](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/features_detection/plot_hog.html) computer vision technique.

Then an unsupervised machine learning method, a [Bayesian Gaussian Mixture](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.mixture.BayesianGaussianMixture.html) model is fitted (instead of conventional K-means) to find a reduced palette. The tied gaussians give a better estimate (than  Euclidean distance) and allow smaller centroids to appear and then lose importance to larger ones further away. The probability mass function returned by the uncalibrated model is then used as a basis for different dithering techniques.

Preprocessing and color space conversion tricks are also applied for better results. Singular Value Decomposition can optionally be enabled for noise reduction. 

## PROTIPs
- There is **no one setting fits all**, try experimenting with different parameters for better results! A setting that generates visually pleasing result on one image might not work well for another.
- The bigger the resulting image, the longer the process will take. Note that most parts of the algorithm are **O(H*W)** so an image that is twice the size will take 4 times longer to compute. 
- Assigning existing palettes will take longer for larger palettes, because [LAB color distance](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.color.html#skimage.color.deltaE_ciede2000) has to be calculated between each color separately. 
- Dithering takes time (especially *atkinson*) as they are mostly implemented in plain python with loops.

## Creating animations
It is possible to use Pyxelate on a sequence of images to create animations. To reduce flicker nd artifacts, it is recommended to first recreate the images as a sequence of keyframes and deviations from previous keyframes, and run the algorithm on these extracted differences only. Then as a second step these altered sequences can be merged on top of each other resulting in a series of pixel graphics.

Pyxelate offers 2 methods to separate keyframes: `images_to_parts`, `parts_to_images`

```python
import os
from skimage import io
from pyxelate import Pyx, Pal, images_to_parts, parts_to_images

# get all images
images = []
for file in os.listdir("where_my_images_are/"):
    image = io.imread(file)
    images.append(image)
    
# generate a new image sequence based on differences between them
new_images, new_keys = [], []
for i, (image, key) in enumerate(images_to_parts(images)):
    if key:  # update palette at keyframes, this can be 'if key == 0' instead
        pyx = Pyx(factor=5, upscale=5, palette=8, dither="naive").fit(image)
    # run the algorithm on the difference only
    image = pyx.transform(image)
    # save the pyxelated image part for later
    new_images.append(image)
    new_keys.append(key)

# put the pyxelated parts back together
for i, image in enumerate(parts_to_images(new_images, new_keys)):
    io.imsave(f"converted_images_with_reduced_flicker/img_{i}.png", image)
```

Or use the CLI tool with `--sequence` and `%d` in both input and output file names:

```bash
$ pyxelate temp/img_%d.png output/img_%d.png --factor 14 --palette 7 --sequence

Pyxelating temp/img_%d.png...
Found 9 '.png' images in 'temp'
...
```
